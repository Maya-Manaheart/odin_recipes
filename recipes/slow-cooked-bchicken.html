<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Designed to be cooked in a crockpot, this recipe is a lot of work for a mediocre lunch you might slap together for the family
    at the end of the week when there isn't much left in the fridge. But hey, if it takes awhile to make it gives them the illusion of being
    of it being of better quality - And your stupid kids won't care either. They're not capable of critical thinking skills until they're teenagers anyway, so for now
    enjoy that their only critisism of your cooking is "Eeew, vegetables."
