<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This is supposed to be "The best carrot cake ever," according to the recipe's original creator. I've had some pretty good carrot cake in my time,
    and I'm not sure this person really understands the task at hand; How important it is to the ecosystem of baking that we don't go around claiming
    the title for best ever carrot cake all willy-nilly. Carrot cake canon has been a hotly debated field for centuries, ever since it's invention circa
    1807 by Roger D. Carrot Cake. To think a plebian could waltz right in and claim victory in carrot cake baking! Here is the recipe, for those who wish to test
    it against tried and true carrot cakes of years past.
