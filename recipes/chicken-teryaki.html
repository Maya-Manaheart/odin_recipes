        <li>0.5 cup of soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ground ginger</li>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the pineapple juice, soy sauce, ginger, garlic powder, and white pepper.
             Reserve a small amount of the marinade separately for dipping later; You know Aunt Marge is going to dunk hers in it like a heathen.</li>
        <li>Place chicken in marinade, and add enough water to cover. Cover, and refrigerate for 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Or an indoor electric grill. Just make sure you use it outside - Assert your grilling dominance over your neighbors.</li>
        <li>Brush grate lightly with oil. Grill chicken 5 to 7 minutes per side, depending on thickness. Chicken is done when inside is no longer pink and juices run clear.</li>
