# odin_recipes

The purpose of this project is to enhance knowledge of HTML and its' uses. For now, at project creation, there will be no need for CSS as it goes beyond
the scope of my practice. The project will be a simple cooking recipes site, which will bring use of all of the basic HTML functions - Links, images and alt text, strong/emphasized text, paragraphs, and headers.

Learned something after first commit: Make sure you have the quotation mark at the end of the commit title, and don't just
continue to use the command line. Your commit title will end up with commands in the title. Oops.
