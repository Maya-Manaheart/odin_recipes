# odin_recipes

The purpose of this project is to enhance knowledge of HTML and its' uses. For now, at project creation, there will be no need for CSS as it goes beyond
the scope of my practice. The project will be a simple cooking recipes site, which will bring use of all of the basic HTML functions - Links, images and alt text, strong/emphasized text, paragraphs, and headers.
